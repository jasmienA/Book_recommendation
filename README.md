# Book_recommendation

Content-Based Filtering: 
The content-based approach uses additional information about users and/or items. This filtering method uses item features to recommend other items similar to what the user likes and also based on their previous actions or explicit feedback. If we consider the example for a movies recommender system, the additional information can be, the age, the sex, the job or any other personal information for users as well as the category, the main actors, the duration or other characteristics for the movies i.e the items.
